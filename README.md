## BMI 713 - Computing Skills for Biomedical Sciences 

### Description
Many data analysis tools require users to have a basic working knowledge of the command line interface (also referred to as *UNIX, Linux, bash, shell*). They also may require the user to have access to resources (i.e. memory, CPU, storage) that exceed what is typically acessible on a personal computer or laptop.  In this session, participants will:

* Learn basic shell commands for navigating the file system
* Explore file contents
* Perform basic operations, such as moving, copying, renaming files/folders
* Learn how to use HMS-RC's O2 cluster for high-performance computing (HPC) 

### Dataset
