## BMI 713 - Computing Skills for Biomedical Sciences 

### Description
Many data analysis tools require users to have a basic working knowledge of the command line interface (also referred to as *UNIX, Linux, bash, shell*). They also may require the user to have access to resources (i.e. memory, CPU, storage) that exceed what is typically acessible on a personal computer or laptop.  In this session, participants will:

* Learn basic shell commands for navigating the file system
* Explore file contents
* Perform basic operations, such as moving, copying, renaming files/folders
* Learn how to use HMS-RC's O2 cluster for high-performance computing (HPC) 

### Dataset
The dataset which is used in the pre-reading activities can be found at the link below. Note, **more detailed instructions for dataset download are found in the pre-reading below.**

### Installation Requirements

## Pre-reading: Introduction to the command-line interface

| Lessons            | Estimated Duration |
|:------------------------|:----------|
|[Introduction to the command line](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/Intro_shell/lessons/01_the_filesystem.html)| 40 min |
|[Concepts and terminology related to High Performance Computing](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-shell-flipped/lessons/08_HPC_intro_and_terms.html) | 20 min |


## In-class: Introduction to High-Performance Computing

> **NOTE:** The following lessons include code that you can follow along with on your own computers. In order to do so, you will need to be **logged into O2**. You can login with your assigned eCommons ID using the command below:
> 
> `ssh eCommonsID@o2.hms.harvard.edu` 
> 
> Press the return/enter key and you should receive a prompt for your password. Type in your password and note that the cursor will not move as you type it in. Once logged in, you should see the O2 icon, some news, and a new command prompt. Now, you are all set!
