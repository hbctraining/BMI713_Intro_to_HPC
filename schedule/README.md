## Introduction to the Command Line Interface
## BMI 713 - Computing Skills for Biomedical Sciences 

### Description

This repository has teaching materials that was adapted for students taking the BMI 713 - Computing Skills for Biomedical Sciences course. The lessons below are hands-on, and students can walk-through the code on their local computers (_login to an HPC cluster is not required_).

Many data analysis tools and computational resources require users to have a basic working knowledge of the command line interface (also referred to as *UNIX, Linux, bash, shell*). In these lessons participants will learn basic commands for navigating the file system, exploring file contents, and performing basic operations, such as moving, copying, and renaming files/folders. 

### Learning Objectives

*  **Accessing the bash shell:** Understanding how to start up the command-line interface
*  **Navigating the file directory:** Recognizing the organization of the file directory and exploring the folders/files
*  **Performing file operations:** Understanding ways to manipulate files, such as moving, copying, and renaming files
*  **Exploring file contents:** Learning how to look at the contents of files
*  **Finding help:** Utilizing resources to determine how to specify desired commands
*  **Searching files:** Practicing searching for patterns within files
*  **Redirecting output:** Using redirection operators to create new files, append contents to an already existing file, and combining commands together
